# Java

**Java** is an object-oriented programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.

## Java Editions
We have four editions of Java, each used for building a different type of
application:
- **Java Standard Edition (SE)** - the core Java platform. It contains all of the
libraries that every Java developer must learn.
- **Java Enterprise Edition (EE)** - used for building very large scale,
distributed systems. Itâ€™s built on top of Java SE and provides additional
libraries for building fault-tolerant, distributed, multi-tier software.
- **Java Micro Edition (ME)** - a subset of Java SE, designed for mobile
devices. It also has libraries specific to mobile devices.
- **Java Card** - used in smart cards.
